# üëã Welcome to GitKraft

GitKraft is a platform for distributing **software as source code** on GitHub, uniquely designed to empower end-users to **easily manage and retain custom, source-level modifications** of the software.

With GitKraft's **GitHub extensions**, users can create **private forks** of software, **customize its source code**, and **update** the software to the latest vendor or community release‚Äîall **without losing customizations**.

## Why Choose GitKraft?

Large organizations often need to **adapt vendor or community software** to meet specific requirements while keeping up with the latest updates. GitKraft provides a modern, efficient toolset for **managing source-code patches**, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods that can lead to delays and security risks. By integrating patch management into the Git version control system, GitKraft **accelerates development and update cycles**, enables rapid vulnerability fixes, and maintains **clear audit trails**. It also fosters open-source collaboration, reducing the need for forks and simplifying contributions back to the community.

One example of software distributed as source code is Helm charts (used for configuring services on the Kubernetes platform). End-users often need to customize Helm charts at the source level, highlighting the need for patch management solutions like GitKraft.

## GitKraft for Open Source

To benefit the public, GitKraft will distribute popular open-source projects on its platform. Initially, all distributed projects will be Helm charts. This initiative is currently in progress. Stay tuned for updates.
